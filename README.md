100 Days of Algorithms
======================

I'm always looking for something to code, some project to make me code every day.
However there are plenty of options, thus I fall in the [The Paradox of Choice](https://www.ted.com/talks/barry_schwartz_on_the_paradox_of_choice)
and end up picking nothing, I just collect a bunch of ideas to start tomorrow.

Inspired by [n-days-challenge](https://www.google.com.br/search?q=days+challenge),
[100 days of algorithms](https://medium.com/100-days-of-algorithms) by Tomáš Bouda,
[100DaysOfCode](http://100daysofcode.com/) and so on. I decided to join in, but
with a wee tweak. It will be 100-days-of-algorithms in 140 days. Let's be honest
life is a hurry (at last mine), the challenge will get into the Xmas break, and
I might lose one day or another because I'm travelling, too tired or anything else.

## The Rules

* Not more than 2 days without coding
* It reads from `stdin` and outputs to `stdout`
* Unit tests, 100% of code coverage (except for the `main` file)
* If I'm without internet access, I can commit it latter
* Today only becomes tomorrow if I sleep or the sun rises. TL;DR 23.59h(today) == 01.00h(tomorrow)
* *Mens sana in corpore sano*, so every day of code is a day of exercise (tip: [a few seconds (at least 30) of plank counts](https://youtu.be/hz7yoy6_HgU?t=8m36s))
