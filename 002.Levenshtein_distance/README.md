Levenshtein Distance
======================

A simple recursive implementation of [Levenshtein distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance).
As it is very inefficient I used memoisation for better performance

## Build

```
$ go build
```

## Run

```
$ ./001.Levenshtein_distance -a="[the first string]" -b="[the second string]" -caseInsensitive[If it should be case insensitive or not]
```

## Help
```
$ ./001.Levenshtein_distance -h
```
